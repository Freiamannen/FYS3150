## This directory is a solution to problem 5.

Compiling and running the scripts (in a Linux terminal):

	g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -larmadillo


	./main.exe


	python3 plottingScript.py


This makes two pdfs and two images with plots of the eigenvector/eigenvalue problem: one of each for n = 10, and the others for n = 100.
