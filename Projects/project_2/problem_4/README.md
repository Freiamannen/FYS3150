## This directory is a solution to problem 4.

Compiling and running the scripts (in a Linux terminal):

	g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -larmadillo


	./main.exe

This outputs the initial R-matrix (for debugging), number of iterations, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors.

The results are commented in the pdf provided.
