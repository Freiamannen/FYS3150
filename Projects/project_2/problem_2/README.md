## This directory is a solution to problem 2.

Compiling and running the scripts (in a Linux terminal):

	g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -larmadillo


	./main.exe

This outputs the result of the actual solutions and the comparison between the numerical solution and the analytical solution to the problem in the terminal.
