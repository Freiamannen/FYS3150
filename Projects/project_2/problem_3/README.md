## This directory is a solution to problem 3.

Compiling and running the scripts (in a Linux terminal):

	g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -larmadillo


	./main.exe

This outputs the matrix evaluated, each of the elements (for debugging) and the actual result: the element with the maximum absolute value on the off-diagonal assuming the matrix evaluated is square and symmetric.
