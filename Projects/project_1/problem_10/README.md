### This is the solution to problem 10

The solution is incomplete.

The "non-special" files are scripts for the general algorithm, while the "special" files are scripts for the special algorithm.

The .txt-files are meant to contain runtime results from executing the compiled codes.

Compiling and running the scripts (in a Linux terminal):


    g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
    
    ./main.exe
    
    ./main.exe
    
    echo "etc."


As mentioned, the solution is incomplete; There is no compiling instructions for the "special" files yet.
